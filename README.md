# Data Pipeline: Spotify Playlist Analysis

This Python script enables the user to input a Spotify playlist URI via command line. Please create a Spotify Developer account to retrieve access keys which will be used with this script.

Upon verification and connecting with Spotify's API, song features are downloaded, 
converted into a Pandas Dataframe and then saved into an Excel Spreadsheet. 

Using Python's MatPlotlib, the results are calculated, graphed and presented in a 3D model.

Also, the graphs are saved into a PDF. 

Please see example of results. 

Enjoy!
